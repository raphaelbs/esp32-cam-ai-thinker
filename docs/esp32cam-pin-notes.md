# Pin Notes

You'll discover most of the pins on the ESP32 cam are already used or have wonky behaviors.  
To make matters a bit more confusing the layout seems to be done by a inebriated engineer or (more likely) a trace auto-router. 
Some of those poor decisions (e.g. not exposing the I2C pins) significantly cripple the possible applications. 
However pins listed as "not exposed" could be accessible using a soldering iron, or a custom FPC in the camera interface.

* MTDI (GPIO12) is used as a bootstrapping pin to select the output voltage of an internal regulator (VDD_SDIO) which powers the flash chip.
* when connected as SDA (for I2C) causes "RTCWDT_RTC_REST"exception ets_main.c 371 at boot due to flash voltage not being set properly. 
* To resolve: it is (Recommended) by EspressIf to Burn the flash voltage selection eFuses. This will permanently configure the internal regulator’s output voltage to 3.3 V, and GPIO12 will not be used as a bootstrapping pin. After that, connect a pull-up resistor to GPIO12.
